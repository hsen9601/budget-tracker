# Budget Tracker

**Budget Tracker** is a web application built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript** that helps users track their income and expenses. This project is part of a learning journey to practice React, Next.js, TypeScript, and client-side state management.

## Features

- User login (mock user and API-based)
- Add, delete, and categorize income/expenses
- Persistent data with `localStorage`
- Responsive and clean interface

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **State Management:** React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Data Persistence:** `localStorage`
- **Routing:** Next.js `useRouter`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/budget-tracker.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

3. Run the development server:

## Usage

### 1. Login with the mock credentials:

- Username: admin

- Password: pass

### 2. Add income or expense entries with a category and type.

### 3. Delete entries as needed.

### 4. Data is saved automatically in localStorage between sessions.

## Learning Goals

- Handling user authentication and protected routes

- Managing state and side effects in React

- Using localStorage for persistent client-side data

- Structuring a Next.js project with TypeScript
